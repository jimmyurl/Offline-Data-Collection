# Offline Data Collection App

## Overview

The Offline Data Collection App is designed to facilitate data gathering in environments with limited or no internet connectivity. This application allows users to collect various data entries, manage them efficiently, and synchronize with a server when online.

## Features

- **Data Entry:** Users can easily add new data entries, including titles, descriptions, and locations.
- **Connectivity Status:** The app displays the current connectivity status (online/offline) to inform users of data synchronization possibilities.
- **Offline Functionality:** Users can collect data without an internet connection; data will be stored locally and synchronized when the connection is restored.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A clean and simple interface that provides an optimal user experience for data collection.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter:** A UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- **Provider:** State management for Flutter that allows for easy management of app state.
- **Shared Preferences:** A persistent storage solution for storing user preferences and app data locally.
- **Connectivity Plus:** A plugin for checking the connectivity status of the device.
